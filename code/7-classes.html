  // Task 1: Below is a variable called person which has an object assigned to it.
  // The object has one property with the key (studentAt) which has a string "Chas" as its
  // value. Add two more properties (keys and values) to the object; one called name which
  // should store your name as a string, and one called age which should store
  // your age as a number.
  
  // Task 2: Add a fourth property to the object using the key `favoriteFoods`. Its value
  // should be an array of strings with some foods you like.

    constructor(studentAt, name, age, favoriteFoods) {
      this.studentAt = studentAt;
      this.name = name;
      this.age = age;

  const myPerson = new Person ("Chas", "Frej", 23, ["Sushi", "Souvas", "Pasta"]);

  // Task 3: Use the dot notation to print the name and age properties from the person
  // object using console.log.
  console.log(myPerson.name);
  console.log(myPerson.age);
  
  
  // Task 4: You can add a property to an object using the dot notation and using assignment to
  // set a its value. Do this to add a new property to the person object with the key `eyeColor`
  // and value being a string with the color of your eyes.
  myPerson.eyeColor = "Hazel";
  console.log(myPerson);
  
  // Task 5: Objects can be nested within other objects. To fetch a value, you must chain
  // the dot notation. For example, you could select the entire `adult` object from the
  // `dog` object below using the notation `dog.labrador.adult`. Using the dog object below,
  // use console.log() to print the name of the puppy (so it should print "Buster").
